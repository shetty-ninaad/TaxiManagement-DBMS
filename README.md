# TaxiManagement-DBMS
This Project is implemented using Oracle DBS and Netbeans IDE. A Taxi Management System has to keep information about their customers. They must offer the customers their choice in car. Also based on availability the car must be booked for the corresponding customer with highest rated driver available. A good management system takes good care of their drivers and their cars. The complete profile of Drivers and Cars must be stored in the database. Importance should also be given to Insurance Details of the car. Finally a reasonable fair should be charged and accounted. It is important to store details like method of payment, receipt no, distance travelled etc..
